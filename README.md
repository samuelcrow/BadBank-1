# DarkBank

<h1>Project Title:</h1> BadBank --> DarkBank -->

<h2>Description/Motivation:</h2> 
As you may be able to tell from the title - this project has been through a few different styles and names due to each new process 
learned during its production. The further it moved along the more character and personality developed. This version is maybe a step backwards 
in design however it is leaps forward in practicality. I am motivated to always learn more and this project really helped me in understanding 
different aspects that make up a functional web application.
